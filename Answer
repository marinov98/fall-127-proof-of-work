Create a file named answer and write down what you think this
17. code does without running it and without looking anything
18. up:
19.
#number = input()
number = 12
i = 2
while i< number:
if number%i==0
  print(i)
i=i+1
From the looks of this, you can type in any number(in this case the number typed
is 12). i is 2 and as long as i is less than the number typed (12) and if
the number multiplied by i gives you 0, then print the letter i and add 1 to it
until it not longer satisfies the while statemnet.
