###Leha is a young man from Belarus. He loves cakes really much.
#In Leha's country, cakes are always evenly divided between people.
#Leha wants to know how many people he should invite to his party
#if he has a cake whose size is equal to u units and
#he wants each person to get exactly  A/B units of cake.
#Note that Leha doesn't take a piece for himself;
#in other words, the cake is only divided among the people he invited to the party.
#Write a function divide(A,B,u) that returns a single integer denoting the number of people he should invite to his party
#For example:
#divide(5,10,1)  would return 2
#because each person would get 5/10 or 1/2 units of cake so he invites 2 people
#and the cake is distributed between them.
#The answer should always be an integer.
u=int()
A=int()
B=int()
def divide(A,B,u):
    B > 0
    return u//(A/B)
print(divide(5,10,1)
